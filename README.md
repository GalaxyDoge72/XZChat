TCP is a great protocol. It allows for seamless communication of data. So I thought, why not make a chatting software server and client similar to Discord with it?

And thus, XZChat was born. It started off with just a simple CLI interface, but once I figured out how to use Windows Forms properly, I got a GUI working.

The server software can be found [here](https://github.com/GalaxyDoge72/XZChatServer).
The GUI works with .NET 9, so you'll need to install the [runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0/runtime) if you want to use the GUI interface.

Also, don't use this for anything that you want to keep private. This chat thing isn't encrypted at all because I'm too fucking stupid to figure out how to use AES.
