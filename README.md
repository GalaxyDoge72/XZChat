TCP is a great protocol. It allows for seamless communication of data. So I thought, why not make a chatting software server and client similar to Discord with it?

And thus, XZChat was born. It started off with just a simple CLI interface, but once I figured out how to use Windows Forms properly, I got a GUI working.
